# Sheep Count
## Here I have installed 3 PIR sensors. Each are placed in line with the entrance with a separation of 20 meters. 
## Now:
1) If the sheep is actually entering the field, the gate sensor and the In sensor will start to detect the heat signature while the sensor at the entrance will not detect the heat signature. Hence we add the count of sheep by one.
2) If the sheep is leaving the field, the gate sensor and the Out Sensor will start to detect heat while the In sensor will not detect any heat. Hence we subtract the count of sheep by one
3) The LED will start glowing until the sheep passes either of the pathways (i.e. till the above 2 conditions take place).
